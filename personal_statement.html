            <p align="justify">Dear AUS Management Team,</p>
            <p align="justify">I was very excited to hear about the open position for development of the An Unlikely Story site! I am currently having fun learning basic html on GoSkills, and had planned on going further with the training offered, taking CSS, JavaScript, and others, on my own time, once training access from AUS was no longer offered. I believe it will be an asset to have basic knowledge of some kind of coding language because it may soon become a requirement for a majority of workers in a variety of fields.</p>
            <P align="justify">I believe I would be a great fit for this position because I enjoy doing tasks that require attention to detail, learning commands, and structuring things in an aesthetically pleasing, and easy-to-access way. Though I am new to basic web development, I have several years of self-taught experience working with Ableton Live, which I use to compose and record electronic music. The Ableton software requires me to work with graphs, troubleshoot issues, and operate within a framework where audio and the midi language is converted into sound someone can hear. I enjoy doing the work necessary to produce the end result.</p>
            <P align="justify">I acknowledge that this position would require me to complete additional training, which I am excited to take on, and develop a thorough awareness of our products, event offerings, and website needs. I am willing to alternate between web development and cafe responsibilities, since I already like my current position with the AUS team!</P>
            <P align="justify">I hope you will consider me for this position!</P>
            <P align="justify"><em>Best regards,</em></P>
            <p align="justify"><em>Briana</em></p>
